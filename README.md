## Firewall Configuration
iptables was used to allow trusted traffic and block unauthorized access.

## IDS/IPS Setup
Snort was configured to detect and prevent suspicious network activities.

## VPN Configuration
OpenVPN was implemented to create a secure encrypted tunnel.

## Traffic Monitoring
Wireshark and Tshark were used to monitor live network traffic.
